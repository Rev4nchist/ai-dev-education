# AI Dev Education Project Rules

This directory contains documentation and guidelines for the AI Development Education website project. These documents serve as the foundation for collaboration, development standards, and project management.

## Contents

### [AI Development Collaboration Rules](./AI_Development_Collaboration_Rules.md)
The prime directive for AI-human collaboration on this project, outlining the principles of constructive interaction, goal setting, communication standards, and our test-driven development approach.

### [AI Dev Education Project Analysis](./AI_Dev_Education_Project_Analysis.md)
A comprehensive analysis of the current state of the project, including strengths, areas for improvement, and recommendations for future development.

### [Implementation Plan](./Implementation_Plan.md)
A detailed plan organizing the development tasks into logical phases, with clear descriptions of test approach, implementation approach, and deliverables for each task.

### [Project Timeline](./Project_Timeline.md)
A structured timeline with sprints, milestones, and deadlines to guide the development process and track progress.

### [Project Status](./Project_Status.md)
Our active task tracking system that documents current sprint tasks, their status, test coverage, and upcoming work. This file is regularly updated throughout development.

### [Project Roadmap](./roadmap/)
Visual roadmap files in multiple formats (CSV for Gantt charts, Markdown for mind maps) to facilitate project planning and visualization in various tools.

### [Coding Standards](./Coding_Standards.md)
Comprehensive guidelines for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and project-specific coding practices to ensure consistency and quality.

### [Test Standards](./Test_Standards.md)
Detailed standards for test-driven development, including test categories, implementation guidelines, workflow, and project-specific testing approaches.

### [Testing Checklist](./Testing_Checklist.md)
A thorough testing methodology covering functional testing, cross-browser compatibility, responsive design, performance, accessibility, and security.

## Our Test-Driven Development Approach

For this project, we follow a strict test-driven development (TDD) approach:

1. **Define the feature** - Clearly specify what we're building and its requirements
2. **Write tests first** - Create tests that define the expected behavior
3. **Implement minimally** - Write just enough code to make the tests pass
4. **Refactor safely** - Improve the implementation while keeping tests passing
5. **Verify completely** - Ensure all tests pass before considering work complete

This approach might seem slower initially but leads to more robust, maintainable code with fewer bugs and clearer functionality.

## How to Use These Documents

1. **For New Contributors**: Start with the Project Analysis to understand the current state and the Collaboration Rules to align with the project's approach.

2. **For Development Planning**: Refer to the Implementation Plan and Project Timeline to understand the scope and schedule of development activities.

3. **For Test-Driven Development**: Consult the Test Standards document to understand our testing approach before beginning any implementation.

4. **For Task Management**: Use the Project Status document to check current task priorities and update progress.

5. **For Visual Planning**: Use the Roadmap files for visualization in Gantt charts or mind mapping software.

6. **During Development**: Follow the Coding Standards to ensure your contributions match the project's quality requirements, and always write tests before implementation.

7. **For Quality Assurance**: Use the Testing Checklist to verify that new features or changes meet all the necessary quality criteria.

## Updating These Documents

These documents should be treated as living resources that evolve with the project:

- Update the Project Analysis when significant new insights are gained
- Revise the Implementation Plan as tasks are completed or priorities shift
- Adjust the Project Timeline to reflect actual progress and changing timelines
- Update Project Status with each task's progress and test results
- Maintain the Roadmap files in sync with Project Status and Timeline
- Expand the Coding Standards as new patterns or technologies are adopted
- Enhance the Test Standards and Testing Checklist as new test cases are identified

All changes to these documents should be reviewed to ensure they align with the project's overall goals and direction.

## Getting Started

If you're new to this project, we recommend following this sequence:

1. Read the Project Analysis to understand the project's purpose and current state
2. Review the Collaboration Rules to understand how we work together
3. Study the Test Standards to understand our test-driven approach
4. Check the Project Status to see the current priorities
5. Check the Implementation Plan to understand the overall work plan
6. Familiarize yourself with the Coding Standards before contributing code
7. Use the Testing Checklist when verifying your changes

## Task Focus

A key principle in our collaboration is maintaining strict focus on the current task:

- Work exclusively on the task at hand
- Avoid making changes unrelated to the current task, even if beneficial
- Complete one task fully before moving to the next
- Document unrelated issues separately for future consideration

By following these guidelines, we ensure a consistent, high-quality development process that leads to an excellent final product.
